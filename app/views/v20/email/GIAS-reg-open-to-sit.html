  Subject: Registration for early career teachers and mentors open for academic year 2026-2027
</div>

<p>Hello ((GIAS_contact_name)),</p>

<p>Our records show that ((sit_name)) (((sit_email-address))) is your school’s induction tutor. We’ve tried to contact them to let them know that registration for early career teachers (ECTs) and mentors is open, but we’ve been unsuccessful.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do</h2>
<p>Forward this email to your school’s induction tutor. It explains how to register ECTS and mentors for training.</p>

<p>If your school does not have an induction tutor, choose one and forward this email to them.</p>

<p>You can read about choosing an induction tutor in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/set-up-and-manage-the-early-career-teacher-entitlement">Set up and manage the early career teacher entitlement</a> guidance.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Register ECTs and mentors</h2>

<p>You can now register early career teachers and mentors for the 2026-2027 academic year with <a href="https://staging.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/">register early career teachers</a>.</p> 

<p>To use the service you’ll need:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a DfE Sign-in account</li>    
        <li>approved access to the service</li>
 </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">DfE Sign-in account and service access</h2>

<p>If you do not have a DfE Sign-in account, <a href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/">you can create one</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to the service, you can request it from your school or organisation’s approver using your DfE Sign-in account.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Confirm your school’s induction tutor for the 2026-2027 academic year</h2>

<p>When you first register ECTs and mentors for this academic year, we’ll ask you to confirm if you’ll be the induction tutor, or if it will be someone else.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sign in</h2>

<p>Sign in to <a href="https://staging.register-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/">register early career teachers</a>.</p> 

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Teacher Continuing Professional Development</p>
<p>Department for Education</p>
