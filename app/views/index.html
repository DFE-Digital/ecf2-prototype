    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Round 2 user research</h2>
    <p>This version contains iterations from the last round to the 'add ECT' journey, mainly focusing on <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-early-career-teachers/issues/372" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">how we ask for programme information</a>.</p>
    <p>We've also included a <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-early-career-teachers/issues/128" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">first design for the 'add mentor' journey</a>, which can be started after adding an ECT without a mentor assigned.</p>
    <p>Finally, this version also contains an additional question in the 'add ECT' journey to ask the user for the <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/register-early-career-teachers/issues/381">ECTs start date</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Round 1 user research</h2>
    <p>This version contains a <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/ecf2/issues/124" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">happy path for adding an ECT</a> for a school user.</p>
    <p>This includes collecting TRN & DoB, to play back the name from the teacher record. It also includes collecting 'default' programme information if a school hasn't added previously, or playing back 'default' programme information if they have.</p>
    <p>Adding a mentor journeys, non-standard inductions, homepages / sign in flows, start dates and adding using checklists / save and return are all out of scope in this prototype version.</p>
